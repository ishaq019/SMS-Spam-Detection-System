A robust machine learning pipeline and web application designed to classify SMS messages as **Spam** or **Ham (Legitimate)** with high precision. This project addresses the challenge of imbalanced text data by utilizing NLP techniques and a probabilistic classifier to minimize false positives.

## 📌 Project Overview

Spam detection is a classic class-imbalance problem where legitimate messages significantly outnumber spam messages. In real-world scenarios, **Precision** is the critical metric—flagging a legitimate message as spam (False Positive) is a severe failure, while missing a spam message (False Negative) is merely an inconvenience.

This project engineers a solution that prioritizes **Zero False Positives**, achieving a **100% Precision score** on the test dataset using Multinomial Naive Bayes.

## ✨ Key Features

* **End-to-End NLP Pipeline:** Automated cleaning, tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming using NLTK.
* **Vectorization:** Implements **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** with a 3,000-feature limit to balance model performance and latency.
* **Probabilistic Modeling:** Utilizes **Multinomial Naive Bayes**, optimized for discrete frequency counts in text data.
* **Interactive Web Interface:** A user-friendly Streamlit frontend for real-time inference and testing.

##📊 Dataset & Model Performance**Dataset:** [UCI SMS Spam Collection Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection)

* **Total Messages:** 5,574
* **Class Distribution:** ~87% Ham (Legitimate), ~13% Spam

**Model Results:**
The model was tuned to prioritize **Precision** over Recall to prevent blocking important emails.

| Metric | Score |
| --- | --- |
| **Precision** | **1.0 (100%)** |
| Accuracy | ~97% |
| Recall | ~0.94 |
| Confusion Matrix | **0 False Positives** |

##🚀 Installation & SetupFollow these steps to set up the project locally.

###1. Clone the Repository```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/sms-spam-classifier.git](https://github.com/your-username/sms-spam-classifier.git)
cd sms-spam-classifier

```

###2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)```bash
# Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# Mac/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

```

###3. Install Dependencies```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

###4. Download NLTK ResourcesThe text preprocessing pipeline requires specific NLTK datasets. Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt'); nltk.download('stopwords')"

```

###5. Generate Model FilesIf `model.pkl` and `vectorizer.pkl` are not present, run the Jupyter Notebook (`sms-spam-detection.ipynb`) to train the model and generate these files.

##🖥️ UsageTo run the web application locally:

```bash
streamlit run app.py

```

A browser window will open automatically at `http://localhost:8501`. Enter any SMS text into the input box to classify it instantly.

##🔮 Future Scope* **Deep Learning Integration:** Experiment with LSTM or BERT transformers to capture semantic context in longer messages.
* **API Deployment:** Wrap the inference logic in a **FastAPI** endpoint for easier integration with other software.
* **Dockerization:** Containerize the application for consistent deployment across cloud platforms (AWS/Azure).
